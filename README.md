# Docmark ðŸ”–

Docmark is a chrome extension built during the challenge days that allows teams to have a shared space in InfoHub to host and maintain bookmarks.

When a new employee joins to Wayfair or a new team, they need quite some time to figure out what is what and where is where.

Currently, the links to Github Repo, CI Platforms, Workboard, Onboarding documents, Okta, Admin Dashboard, etc. are delivered to people in a disorganized manner.

Docmark aims at improving this orientation time and also providing a good solution to sharing common bookmarks among teammates.

Docmark utilizes InfoHub pages, to create and maintain a bookmark tree, which can be edited directly on InfoHub's WYSIWYG editor.

With a click of a button, users visiting to that InfoHub article (marked by a ðŸ”– emoji) can add the bookmark tree (or update it) to their browsers.
